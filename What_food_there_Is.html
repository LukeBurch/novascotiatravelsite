        <p>Some places there have a very tasty english breakfast as I personally have had by experience</p>
        <p>Donairs: Introduced by Lebanese immigrants to Halifax in the 1970s, 
            the donair has become a beloved local specialty. Similar to a gyro or shawarma, 
            the donair features seasoned beef cooked on a vertical rotisserie and served in a pita with onions, 
            tomatoes, and a sweet garlic sauce.</p>

        <p>Seafood: 
            Given its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, seafood features prominently in Nova Scotian cuisine. 
            Lobster, scallops, mussels, oysters, and various species of fish such as salmon, haddock, and cod are all commonly enjoyed. 
            These seafood delicacies are often prepared simply to let their natural flavors shine, whether grilled, steamed, or served in chowders and stews.</p>
